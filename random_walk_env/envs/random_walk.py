        The Random Walk Environment is a custom Gymnasium environment that simulates a simple random walk process.
        The agent starts in a predefined state and moves randomly to adjacent states (left or right) at each timestep.
        The states are arranged in a row, with terminal states at both ends.
        The rightmost terminal state rewards the agent with +1, while all other transitions have a reward of 0.
        The environment is ideal for experiments in reinforcement learning or Markov Reward Processes (MRPs), focusing on stochastic state transitions without actions.
